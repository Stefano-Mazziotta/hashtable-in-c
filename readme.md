# Hash Table Implementation in C

This is a basic implementation of a hash table in C programming language. The code provides functionalities to insert, lookup, and delete elements from the hash table.

## Features

- **Hash Function:** Uses a simple hash function to determine the index for storing elements in the hash table.
- **Collision Handling:** Resolves collisions using separate chaining by maintaining a linked list at each index.
- **Initialization:** Initializes the hash table with a specified size.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stefano-mazziotta/hash-table-c.git
   ```

2. Compile the code using the provided makefile::

   ```bash
   make main
   ```

3. Run the executable:

   ```bash
   ./_output/hash_table
   ```
